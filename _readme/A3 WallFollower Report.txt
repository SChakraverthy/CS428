WallFollower Implementation-------------------------
To Run: uncomment line xxx : "prefForce = wallFollower();"
The first thing wallFollower does is search for neighbors around it. It then iterates through the list of
neighbors and finds the ones that are not agents, thus any obstacle neighbor. While it's doing that, it
keeps track of which one is closest to the agent in question via the pointBoundDistance function. PointBoundDistance
basically just takes in a box and a point and performs the distance equation on it, returning the minimum.
After the closest wall is determined, the normal of that wall is gathered through calcWallNormal, then the cross
product of that normal and the vector (0,1,0) is returned. In updateAI, prefForce is set to that cross product.


WallFollower Benchmark------------------------------

             total number of agents: 1
avg. number of collisions per agent: 0
    average time spent by one agent: 147.904
  average energy spent by one agent: 0
 sum of instantaneous accelerations: 0
(alpha, beta, gamma, delta) weights: (50,1,1,1)
                       weighted sum: 50*0 + 1*147.904 + 1*0 + 1*0 = 147.904
                        final score: 147.904
